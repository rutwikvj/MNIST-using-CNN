MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognition Using CNN (Base and Improved Model)

The MNIST dataset is a handwritten digit dataset. MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology. The dataset consists of 70,000 images in the of handwritten numbers between 0 and 9. The train dataset consists of 60,000 images while the Test dataset consists of 10,000 images. The images are grayscale and are of the size 28 by 28 pixels. The MNIST dataset also consists of the correct classifications for each of these 70,000 images which can be used for training and to evaluate our modelâ€™s accuracy in testing. This model  recognizes the handwritten digits and classifies them into one on the 10 digits starting from 0 to 9.
